Common excel troubleshooting technique
Common Excel Issues:One common issue is related to formula complications, where even a small error can bring misleading results or “#ERROR!” messages.
Excel Error Messages:#DIV/0!: This error appears when a formula tries to divide a number by zero or an empty cell.
#VALUE!: This is shown when Excel finds the wrong type of argument in a formula.
#REF!: This occurs when a reference in a formula is invalid, often due to deleted cells or incorrect range names.
#NAME?: This error shows that Excel doesn’t recognize a function name or text in a formula.
#NUM!: This error appears when a formula or function contains invalid numeric values.
#N/A: It shows that a value is not available to a function or formula.
